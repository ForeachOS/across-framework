This chapter explains the terminology and fundamental concepts involved with developing Across applications and modules.
Understanding these terms and concepts is a prerequisite for working with Across.

== Required knowledge
To be able to develop with Across, you need a good grasp of Java (8) and Spring Framework.
Spring MVC experience is strongly advised, and some Spring Boot knowledge might be helpful.

At the very least you should be familiar with Springâ€™s approach for dependency injection, the `ApplicationContext` and java-based configuration.

Other commonly used libraries that are useful to know are Hibernate, Spring Data, Liquibase and Thymeleaf.

=== Across and Spring framework
{spring-url}[Spring framework] is a de facto industry standard for building Java (web) applications.  It was a logical
 choice to use it as the foundation for Across.  Across extends or even customizes some aspects of Spring, but still supports
 most if not all common Spring functions out of the box.  To use Across optimally, a good knowledge of Spring is required.

<<across-core>> and <<across-web>> build on top of the common Spring framework, while other <<across-standard-modules,standard modules>> integrate different
Spring libraries like {spring-data-url}[Spring Data], {spring-batch-url}[Spring Batch] or {spring-security-url}[Spring security].

== Across Framework

[[across-platform]]
== Across Platform
Across platform provides a single BOM pom that has a curated list of dependencies for both Across core and Across Standard Modules.
Using the platform is advised for Across based applications as the platform will ensure different module versions play together nicely.

[[across-standard-modules]]
== Across Standard Modules
Apart from the Across framework itself, a different project maintains a set of Across standard modules.  These modules aim
 to be productivity enhancers by providing you with a common set of functionality that can be used as the foundation
 for your applications or even for an entire web cms.

There are standard modules that provide you with the set-up for an administrative web interface, secured with
 {spring-security-url}[Spring security] and built on top of an entire roles and permissions management domain layer.
 Other modules generate web forms at runtime for persistent entities you have declared in your application.

Across framework provides only a ground layer, the real win is in re-using well-defined modules that have already
been built.  The standard modules projects aims to do exactly that: bring some best of breed modules to the open source Across landscape.
