=== RefreshableRegistry
A RefreshableRegistry is a collection of beans of a specified class that updates itself on every context refresh.  A RefreshableRegistry can also scan for beans inside the other modules in the running context, without the need for those beans to be exposed.  This allows other modules to pick up extensions or configurations from other modules that bootstrap later, and update its configuration on the context bootstrapped event.
The members of a RefreshableRegistry are also ordered according to the Across module order hierarchy (see section Ordering beans).
